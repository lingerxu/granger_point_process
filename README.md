# Toolkit for Discovering Directional Influences in Time Series Data with Granger Causality
by Tian Linger Xu

STEPS to use this toolkit:
1. Download a clone of this toolkit to your own labtop. You can click the green button `Clone or download` to download a ZIP file. Or, if you use Git Bash, simply type in:
```
git clone https://github.com/lingerxu/granger_point_process.git
```
2. Open Matlab and set your working path to the folder containing the downloaded toolkit.

3. Open a demo*.m file, start running!

My presentation slides on the introduction of Granger Causality and detailed explanation on how to calculate Granger Causality in a multimodal infant-parent interaction dataset can be found here: [Discovering Temporal Dependencies and Directional Influences in Multimodal Time Series with Granger Causality](2018_Gcause_slides_xu.pdf).

[This folder](relevant_papers\) has several relevant papers on this technique.
